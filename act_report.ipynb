    "I loaded the saved 'twitter_archive_master.csv' file and saved it to the data frame df. To check the distribution of data, I drew box plots for 'rating_numerator', 'retweet_count', and 'favorite_count'. As a result, clear outliers were found in 'rating_numerator'. Afterwards, it was decided to proceed with the analysis by excluding some outliers that greatly interfere with the observation of trends in the scatter plot. When a scatter plot was drawn with the axes 'retweet_count' and 'rating_numerator', a positive correlation was found. A similar correlation was found when the scatter plot of 'favorite_count' and 'rating_numerator' was drawn.\n",

    "In the 'stage' column, there are 4 types of categories except for null values, 'pupper', 'doggo', 'puppo', and 'floofer'. To see the relationship between the 4 types of stages and 'rating_numerator', a box plot was drawn. As a result, it was found that in the case of 'pupper', the median value of 'rating_numerator' was significantly lower than that of the other three stages.\n",

    "Two types of bar plots were drawn to find out which breeds and names account for a large proportion. We were able to identify the 10 dog breeds that accounted for the largest percentage and 20 names. In terms of dog breeds, 'golden_retriever' accounted for a remarkably large proportion, and 'Cooper', 'Lucy', 'Charlie', and 'Oliver' each accounted for a large proportion with 10 names.\n",

    "A plot date was drawn to know the change trend of 'retweet_count' and 'favorite_count' over time. An upward trend was not clearly seen in 'retweet_count', but an upward trend was observed in 'favorite_count'."
