## Quality issues

* Replies and retweets are to drop

* Need to find the breed that corresponds to each tweet

* tweet_id in counts is data type object

* There are cases where rating_denominator is not 10

* timestamp datatype is not datetime

* retweet_count and favorite_count are not integer

* stage data type would be better as 'category'

* 'None' and 'a' in name column

## Tidiness issues

* twitter_archive_enhanced_copy and breeds can be merged

* twitter_archive_enhanced_copy and counts_copy can be merged

* Columns doggo, floofer, pupper, puppo can be in one column
